1. Smart Contracts remove third parties/middlemen like lawyers, brokers from the System, thus improving efficiency and reducing the cost of drafting the agreement.
<br>
<br>
2. Smart Contracts can be used to automate tasks of Payments, Asset Management and most importantly Verification of Landlord, Tenant and the Property itself.
<br>
<br>
3. These contracts empower Landlords to draft their own agreements and digitally sign them , tenants can later on verify these agreements and can sign these contracts making them active on the Blockchain.
<br>
<br>
4. Smart Contracts can process and transfer payment of Rent, Security Deposit and Stamp Duty Fee automatically when certain predefined conditions are satisfied, this is what makes them Smart ðŸ˜Ž
<br>
<br>
5. Smart Contracts can hold the Security Deposit in an Escrow Account and release it when the Contract Expires or both parties provide their approval.
