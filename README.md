**What are Smart Contracts and Why Use Them ?**

- Like the Physical Contracts between organizations in Real World, smart contracts define the terms and conditions of contracts on a Digital Ledger, what makes these contracts 'Smart' is their capability of making automatic payments, when certain conditions are met. 

- They automate the task of verification and payment processing and remove the third parties involved in the process thus making it more secure and faster. 

- Once deployed a smart contract is tamper proof, and will permanently reside over the ledger, payments are done using Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum between organizations. 



**Technology Behind this Product**

Ethereum Smart Contracts - Provide the back end database to save the contracts details, terms and conditions. The users interact with the contracts which are hosted on the Ropsten TestNet. Ethereum Smart Contract will be deployed by the Landlord and the Tenant will confirm the details which will make the contract active. 

IPFS Protocol - This product is just a Test Application and cannot be used as a Valid Proof in any Official Procedure, users still require their "Real World" Rent Contracts and for these purposes we deploy these Physical Contracts with the Digital Contracts using IPFS Distributed Storage. 


**Terms and Conditions ( Read Carefully )**

1. The application is based on Ethereum Blockchain and hence is a public ledger application, I understand all my contract details will be publicly visible. 

2. The application is just a POC (proof-of-concept) showcasing the capabilities of Digital Smart Contracts, I understand that these contacts do not have any legal standings and cannot be used in any government trials and procedures as proof. 

3. The application is designed as per the rental guidelines of Delhi Government and all the charges including Rent, Security and Registration Fees are calculated in Indian Rupees (INR). 

4. Currently, the Smart Contracts are uploaded on Ropsten TestNet and the owner of the Contract is the creator (Anudish Jain), no real life assets are currently being used for transactions on this application just Test Coins of Zero Monetary Value. 

5. I understand that the future versions will have governments as the SOLE OWNERS of these contracts designing and implementing the new guidelines, I will help support this platform by only uploading authenticate and accurate data. 

6. I will be required to use MetaMask for registration on this application and will be using the same for future interactions with this application.
